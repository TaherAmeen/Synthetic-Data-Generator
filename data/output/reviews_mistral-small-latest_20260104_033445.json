        "comment": "As someone tasked with training a new team on course creation, I found this platform to be a mixed bag. On one hand, the variety of templates was incredibly helpful in setting up a standardized course structure quickly. This was crucial for ensuring consistency across our training materials. The intuitive design made it easy for my team to get started, and the quick learning curve meant that we could focus more on content creation rather than figuring out how to use the tool. However, the limitations became apparent when we needed to incorporate more interactive elements. The lack of advanced features, such as a wider variety of question types, made it challenging to create engaging and dynamic courses. We had to rely on workarounds, which added an extra layer of complexity to the process. Additionally, the mobile responsiveness was not as robust as we had hoped, especially when it came to interactive elements. This was a significant drawback for our team, as we often needed to access and update courses on the go. The pricing also felt steep for the features offered, making it a less attractive option for budget-conscious users. Overall, while the platform excels in ease of use and basic course creation, it falls short in areas that require more advanced functionalities and robust mobile support.",
        "pros": "The variety of templates and intuitive design made it easy to set up and customize courses quickly. The quick learning curve allowed our team to focus on content creation rather than navigating the tool.",
        "cons": "Limited question types and advanced features made it difficult to create engaging courses. Mobile responsiveness issues and high pricing were also significant drawbacks.",

The experience was a mix of positive and challenging moments. The variety of templates available was a significant time-saver, allowing me to quickly create visually appealing and consistent training modules. This was particularly useful for ensuring that all new hires received the same high-quality training regardless of their location or device. However, the mobile responsiveness left much to be desired. While the courses were accessible on mobile devices, interactive elements often did not function as smoothly as they did on desktop, which was a significant drawback for trainees who preferred to learn on the go. Additionally, the lack of advanced features such as branching scenarios limited the depth and interactivity of the courses I could create. Despite these issues, the customer support was excellent, providing timely and helpful assistance whenever I encountered problems. Overall, while the platform offers some useful features, it falls short in areas critical for delivering comprehensive and engaging training.",
